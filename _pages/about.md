<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou (HKUSTGZ), supervised by Prof. Li Liu. My research interests include medical image analysis, drug design, and Multi-modal Cued Speech Recognition and Gesture Generation. My research mainly focuses on Multi-modal learning, active learning and semi-supervised learning.
